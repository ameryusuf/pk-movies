# Pakistan Movies Dataset

## About

### The dataset contains information about Pakistani movies produced since 1948. The dataset has been updated to include movies released till 2015 with a few upcoming titles. There is not a single comprehensive database for Pakistani movies nor a body that keeps an official public record of Pakistani films. The dataset is compiled by scraping relevant websites with the information uploaded and maintained by individuals.   

### The first row of the dataset is the header and as of April 21, 2016, there are 4336 records with 12 variables in the dataset.

### There is a lot of missing data filled with '?' in many instances but there are also a lot of null values which should be interpreted as NAs.

### The dataset is ordered by year in ascending order starting from the first record from August 7th. 1948. The date format is Year-Month-Day.

### Please keep in mind the information in the dataset is not from an official source nor is approved by a governing body that oversees the production of films/movies in Pakistan.

### Also, a special mention for http://Mazhar.dk, a site which is dedicated to providing information about Pakistan. It is also the primary source of information for this dataset.
